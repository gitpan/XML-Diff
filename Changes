   into template anymore)
 - handle namespaced attributes in diffgram (i.e. <foo bar:baz="1"/>
   doesn't turn into <foo baz="1"/> anymore)

 - fixed bug with handling blank or 0 valued attributes
 - fixed bug with nodePaths of inserts
 - sped up node matching (still pending complete rewrite)

   break the diffgram now

 - new matching algorithm reigns in exponential growth of match time on
   large sets of similar nodes, and speeds up matching about 30% overall

   diffgrams on XML with many nodes of similar structure
 - fixed bug with inserts of subtrees that were targets of node moves
 - added more tests to harness

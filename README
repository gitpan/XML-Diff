XML-Diff version 0.01
=====================

This module provides methods for generating and applying an XML
diffgram of two related XML files. The basis of the algorithm
is tree-wise comparison using the DOM model as provided by
XML::LibXML.

The Diffgram is well-formed XML in the XVCS namespance and
supports update, insert, delete and move operations. It is
meant to be human and machine readable. It uses XPath expressions
for locating the nodes to operate on.

See the Perldoc for more details about this module.

Also see TODO for planned additions for this module.
